## BitcoinZ Principles: 
- Anonymous
It is recommended to use anonymous zaddr for all transactions. Public taddrs transactions are also allowed.
- All contributors are welcome and everyone is volunteer - no premine or dev taxes (Satoshi has about 10% of BTC marketcap!)
- Store of value - always POW and never POS
- Fully decentralized cryptocurrency (no root domain, no main website, no main dev team)
- Decentralized development
Developers are self organized in development pods. Every new dev or team is welcome. All implementations which follow consensus are allowed. No need to register - just create new pod account (e.g. github) and convince community.
- Decentralized mining
As a miner you should not use the biggest pools to follow main principles.
- Easy to mine
Equihash algorithm.
You can use your Desktop PC to mine BitcoinZ. Most profitable is GPU mining.
- Decentalized Exchanges
All exchanges are allowed. The best one are decentralized. We plan to implement fully decentralized XCAT exchange.
- Pure community coin
- Always immutable - no way to change history!
